            <!-- Case Study: Anglesey Crossbow Murder -->
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">The Anglesey Crossbow Murder</h2>
            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
                In 2010, a 34 year old man, Michael Hutton, was shot and killed with a crossbow outside of his remote home on the island of Anglesey, Wales.<br><br>
                Investigators narrowed down suspects based on who owned crossbows in the area. From this, they narrowed it down to one suspect, David Foulkes.
                David claimed that his Jaguar SUV had been stolen, and was later found burnt out. However, the vehicle had been recording data up until it was burned, and the data was sent to Jaguar Land Rover.<br><br>

                <br> When the police accessed this data, they could see that the night before the murder, David had driven to the house and stayed there for a period of time, before returning home. The next day, around the time of the murder
                David had returned to Michael's house and opened his boot for a period of time. The data then showed that David had returned to the vehicle after a period of time, and once again opened and shut the boot of his vehicle. <br><br>
                Prosecutors argued that this series of events was David retrieving the crossbow from his boot, committing the murder and then returning to the vehicle and placing the murder weapon in the boot. With this information, David was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison

            <!-- Case Study: Tesla Autopilot Crashes -->
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Tesla Autopilot Crashes</h2>
            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
                There have been numerous crashes due to Tesla's autonomous driving technology. After these crashes occur, telemetry data is crucial to piecing together what went wrong <br><br>

                One example of such an incident was in Florida in 2019, when a Tesla Model 3 collided with a truck on a highway. Data collected from the Tesla showed that the autopilot was engaged around 10
                seconds before the collision, and that the driver's hands were not on the wheel during this time. The report also found that at no time before the crash did the driver brake or initiate evasive steering action.<br><br>

                These valuable insights, especially in a post-crash scenario, show the importance of vehicle forensics in an investigation.
