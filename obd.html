                What is OBD and why is it important?

            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
                On-Board Diagnostics refers to a collection of system data that is stored about a vehicle, often used for monitoring the health of an engine and identifying issues that may be occurring.
                This data can provide valuable insights when investigating a range of different scenarios. We will discuss some of these below:

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">2009-2011 Toyota Acceleration Recalls</h2>
            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
                In the late 2010s, Toyota were forced to recall approximately 7.5million vehicles after reports that vehicles were unintendingly acceleratoring. Initially, Toyota believed the problem was
                 solely down to floor mats that hid slid forward, and caused the accelerator pedal to become stuck. Whilst this was correct, and led to over 5 million vehicles being recalled,
                  they had a different issue on their hands. <br> <br>

                    On the 28th of August, 2009, in San Diego California, a passenger of a Toyota Lexus sedan rang 911 and stated that they were acceleratoring uncontrollably.
                     This resulted in them crashing, and all four occupants of the vehicle died. Upon inspection of the vehicle, it was found that the floor mats had been stored in the boot,
                      in the advice of Toyota. This meant they had a new problem. Investigators of the crash used OBD data to confirm that the vehicle had been acceleratoring fully, but also braking.
                       This confirmed to them that there was a problem with the accelerator pedal. Unexpectedly, a team from NASA investigated the so called "sticky pedal" problem,
                        but found no software issues. During investigations, it was found that this problem had led to 90 deaths. In the worst case scenario, when a pedal
                        is pushed to a specific settings, it stays at that level of power even if the driver removes their foot from the pedal.<br><br>

                        Toyota were taken to court, and resulted in paying over $1.2 billion for allegedly concealing information about flawed pedals, the largest penalty imposed on an automaker
                         from the US Justice Department at the time.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">OBD Extraction</h2>
            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
                The first step in extraction is locating the OBD port. In almost every vehicle the OBD-II port is located in the same place, beneath the dashboard and steering wheel. It is a standardised 16 pin connector.
                <br><br>The next step is to select an OBD adapter. These are widely available and can be purchased on Amazon. There are various forms, including USB and bluetooth.
                We then connect our adadpter by inserting it into the socket underneath the steering wheel, then connecting via our chosen method, eg USB or Bluetooth.

                For USB devices, this data can be collected by using various softwares, some examples of these include VCMScanner and VCDS. However, when selecting a software to use is important to research it first
                 as many softwares focus on specific makes and models, such as VCDS which is primarily used for Volkswagen vehicles. For Bluetooth devices, this data can be recorded directly to apps such as Car Scanner, which allows OBD data to be streamed straight to
                  an iOS or Android device.
